# Project Idea: Motor control

This guide will walk you through the basics. This is not a full tutorial, and some info may be left out.

This project is based off the ESP-32 WROOM.


# Components List

- Sparkfun Thing Plus - ESP-32 WROOM
- L293D Micro-controller (Motor control)
- ~8 different sized jumper cables
- A DC motor (I am using a 3V-6V motor in this example)
